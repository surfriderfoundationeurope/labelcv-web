<!--- OPTIONAL: You can add badges and shields to reflect the current status of the project, the licence it uses and if any dependencies it uses are up-to-date. Plus they look pretty cool! You can find a list of badges or design your own at https://shields.io/ --->

<!--- TODO: Give a short introduction of product. Let this section explain the objectives or the motivation behind this product. Add a line of information text about what the product does. Your introduction should be around 2 or 3 sentences.--->
This is the source code of [Trashroulette](https://www.trashroulette.com/#/).This application is used to manually annotate images.  It can be used to build datasets of labelled images featuring items of interest, in order to train an artificial intelligence model to detect and count those items. At Surfrider, we're labeling litter items.

Welcome to **Plastic Origin labelcv-web**, a Web UI for Label CV platform that allows `<insert_target_audience>` to do `<action/task_it_does>`.

## **Getting Started**
<!--- TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system.--->

### **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
<!--- These are just example requirements. Add, duplicate or remove as required --->
* You have installed [`Node.js 13 or latest`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)



#### **Technical stack**
* Language: `javascript` and `typescript`
* Framework: `Vue` and `Vuex`
* Unit test framework: `Jest`
* Linter : `eslint`

### **Installation**

<!--- TODO: It's a code block illustrating how to install. Include any system-specific information needed for installation. If there are multiple versions which the user may interface with, an updating section would be useful. Add Dependencies subsection if there are unusual dependencies or dependencies that must be manually installed.--->

<!--- These are just example (copied from current readme file): add, duplicate or remove as required --->
To **INSTALL FRONT**, follow these steps:
 ```
git clone https://github.com/surfriderfoundationeurope/labelcv-web
cd
git fetch 
git checkout refacto-from-develop
```

To **LAUNCH FRONT**:
```
npm install 
npm run serve
```

### **Usage**
<!---TODO: It's a code block illustrating common usage that might cover basic choices that may affect usage (for instance, if JavaScript, cover promises/callbacks, ES6). If CLI importable, code block indicating both import functionality and usage (if CLI functionality exists, add CLI subsection).If relevant, point to a runnable file for the usage code.--->

<!--- These are just example: Add run commands and examples you think users will find useful  --->

There are three different usage possible : 
- In development with in memory images and trash-types : nothing special to do, it will fall back to this mode if no config files are found. 
- In development with a local API : 
  1. Follow the instruction on how to launch LabelCV backend at the end of this README. 
  2. create a file `./public/config.prod.json` with `{"url": "http://localhost:443/" }`
- In production : create a file `./public/config.prod.json` with `{"url": "path/to/labelCV/api" }`
 


<!--- If needed add here any Extra Sections (must have their own titles).Specifically, the Security section should be here if it wasn't important enough to be placed above.-->

### **API references**
<!---TODO: Describe exported functions and objects. Describe signatures, return types, callbacks, and events. Cover types covered where not obvious. Describe caveats. If using an external API generator (like go-doc, js-doc, or so on), point to an external API.md file. This can be the only item in the section, if present.--->

<!--- If an external API file is work in progress and/or you are planning to host API specification in the Swagger documentation, you can use the text below as exaple: add, duplicate or remove as required -->
*SOON: To see API specification used by this repository browse to the Swagger documentation (currently not available).*

## **Build and Test**
<!---TODO: Describe and show how to build your code and run the tests.--->

## **Contributing**

It's great to have you here! We welcome any help and thank you in advance for your contributions.

* Feel free to **report a problem/bug** or **propose an improvement** by creating a [new issue](https://github.com/surfriderfoundationeurope/labelcv-web/issues). Please document as much as possible the steps to reproduce your problem (even better with screenshots).
