Welcome to **Plastic Origin labelcv-web** - a Web UI for Label CV platform - the source code of [Trashroulette](https://www.trashroulette.com/#/) used to manually annotate images.  It can be used to build datasets of labelled images featuring items of interest in order to train an artificial intelligence model to detect and count those items. At Surfrider, we're labeling litter items.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have installed [`Node.js 13 or latest`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

#### **Technical stack**
* Language: `javascript` and `typescript`
* Framework: `Vue` and `Vuex`
* Unit test framework: `Jest`
* Linter : `eslint`

### **Installation**

To **INSTALL FRONT**, follow these steps:
 ```
git clone https://github.com/surfriderfoundationeurope/labelcv-web
cd
git fetch 
git checkout refacto-from-develop
```

To **LAUNCH FRONT**:
```
npm install 
npm run serve
```

### **Usage**

There are three different usage possible : 
- In development with in memory images and trash-types : nothing special to do, it will fall back to this mode if no config files are found. 
- In development with a local API : 
  1. Follow the instruction on how to launch LabelCV backend described in the [Additional information](##Additionalinformation) section at the end of this README. 
  2. create a file `./public/config.prod.json` with `{"url": "http://localhost:443/" }`
- In production : create a file `./public/config.prod.json` with `{"url": "path/to/labelCV/api" }`
